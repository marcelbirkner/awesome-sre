# Java

**Java** is a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level\_programming\_language), [class-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based\_programming), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented\_programming) [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming\_language) that is designed to have as few implementation [dependencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency\_\(computer\_science\)) as possible. It is a [general-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose\_language) programming language intended to let [programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) _write once, run anywhere_ (WORA),[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\_\(programming\_language\)#cite\_note-17) meaning that [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\_\(programming\_language\)#cite\_note-design\_goals-18) Java applications are typically compiled to [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\_bytecode) that can run on any [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\_virtual\_machine) (JVM) regardless of the underlying [computer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_architecture).&#x20;
